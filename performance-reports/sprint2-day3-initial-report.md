# Performance Report - Sprint 2 Day 3
## State Migration Monitoring - Initial Report

**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Time**: 10:00 AM  
**Sprint**: Sprint 2 - State Management Migration  
**Day**: Day 3 - Migration Implementation  

## Executive Summary

Performance monitoring infrastructure has been successfully established for tracking the state migration from Zustand to React Query. All monitoring tools are in place and ready to track:

- Memory usage and potential leaks
- React Query cache efficiency
- IndexedDB persistence overhead
- Component re-render patterns
- Bundle size impact

## Current Performance Baseline

### Memory Usage
- **Baseline**: 4.49 MB (heap used)
- **Target**: < 5% increase during migration
- **Current**: Monitoring active, awaiting migration data

### React Query Cache
- **Target Hit Rate**: > 80%
- **Configuration**: 
  - Stale time: 5 minutes
  - GC time: 10 minutes
  - Retry: 2 attempts

### Persistence Layer
- **Target Latency**: < 50ms read/write
- **Throttle Time**: 1000ms default
- **Max Age**: 24 hours

### Bundle Size
- **Current**: 529 KB (main app)
- **Target**: < 15KB increase (544 KB max)

## Monitoring Infrastructure Deployed

### 1. Server-Side Monitor (`monitor-state-migration.js`)
- Tracks memory, cache, persistence, and component metrics
- Generates reports every minute
- Alerts on threshold violations
- Saves detailed JSON reports

### 2. Client-Side Hook (`usePerformanceMonitor`)
- Real-time React Query cache monitoring
- Memory usage tracking (when available)
- Performance alert generation
- Exportable metrics

### 3. Persistence Monitor (`performance-monitor.ts`)
- IndexedDB operation tracking
- Read/write latency measurement
- Throttling and batching metrics
- Storage usage monitoring

### 4. Visual Dashboard
- Real-time performance metrics display
- Component render tracking
- Alert visualization
- Metrics export functionality

### 5. Performance Monitor Component
- Floating performance HUD
- Minimizable interface
- Real-time alerts
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P)

## Key Metrics to Track

### Critical Metrics (Immediate Alerts)
1. **Memory Spike > 10%**
   - Baseline: 4.49 MB
   - Alert threshold: 4.94 MB
   
2. **Cache Hit Rate < 80%**
   - Indicates inefficient query keys
   - May signal over-fetching
   
3. **Persistence Latency > 100ms**
   - Read or write operations
   - May impact user experience
   
4. **Bundle Size Increase > 20KB**
   - Would exceed 549 KB total
   - Requires immediate optimization

### Performance Indicators
1. **Component Re-renders**
   - Track high-frequency renders
   - Identify optimization targets
   
2. **Query Deduplication Rate**
   - Measure query efficiency
   - Target: < 20% duplicate queries
   
3. **Throttled Writes**
   - Persistence layer efficiency
   - Target: < 30% throttle rate

## Optimization Opportunities Identified

### 1. Lazy Loading Strategy
- Current: All components loaded upfront
- Opportunity: Lazy load heavy components
- Expected impact: -50KB initial bundle

### 2. Virtual Scrolling
- Current: Full list rendering
- Opportunity: Implement windowing
- Expected impact: -30% memory usage for large lists

### 3. Query Intervals
- Current: Default refetch on mount
- Opportunity: Smart refetch based on feed update frequency
- Expected impact: -40% unnecessary API calls

### 4. Memoization Gaps
- Several components lack React.memo
- Callback functions not memoized
- Expected impact: -20% re-renders

## Migration Monitoring Plan

### Hour 1-2: Initial Migration
- Monitor memory baseline
- Track first React Query implementations
- Verify no immediate regressions

### Hour 3-4: Persistence Integration
- Monitor IndexedDB latency
- Track storage growth
- Verify throttling effectiveness

### Hour 5-6: Full Migration
- Compare before/after metrics
- Identify optimization needs
- Generate comparison report

### Hour 7-8: Optimization Phase
- Implement critical optimizations
- Verify improvements
- Final performance assessment

## Alert Thresholds Configured

```javascript
THRESHOLDS = {
  memoryIncrease: 0.1,        // 10% increase
  cacheHitRate: 0.8,          // 80% minimum
  persistenceLatency: 100,     // 100ms maximum
  bundleSizeIncrease: 20480,   // 20KB increase
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Migration Monitoring**
   - Start `monitor-state-migration.js` script
   - Enable performance HUD in development
   - Watch for initial alerts

2. **Track Key Operations**
   - First React Query implementation
   - First persistence write
   - First cache hit/miss

3. **Hourly Reports**
   - Generate comparative analysis
   - Identify trending issues
   - Recommend optimizations

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Start performance monitoring
node scripts/monitor-state-migration.js

# View real-time metrics in browser
# Navigate to /web/performance

# Enable performance HUD
# Press Ctrl+Shift+P in the app

# Export metrics from browser console
__PERFORMANCE_MONITOR__.export()
```
