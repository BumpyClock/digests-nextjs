I am a news junkie. The problem with a lot of readers is they they are designed to keep you in a bubble, and hack your engagement to ultimately sell you ads. 

Digests is different. All the code is public, you can self host both the web app and the API server if you want. Or you can use the hosted version. 

Either way, there is no tracking, no algorithms to manipulate you, no ads. You decide what you want to read or listen to.

When you want to move to a new reader, you can export your subscriptions and take them with you.

Import/export is in OPML format.

Digests is a labor of love but it is still a work in progress and in active development. There are bugs, and some features are missing.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BumpyClock/digests-nextjs) to open an issue or submit a PR.
