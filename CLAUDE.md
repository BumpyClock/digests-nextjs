# Digests

Digests is a RSS Reader and Podcast Player built with React. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use. It supports both RSS and Atom feeds, and it can also play podcasts.

- Focus is on a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to manage their feeds and listen to their favorite podcasts. The application is built with modern web technologies, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience across different devices.

- Use shared design tokens for consistent styling and theming across the application. This allows for easy customization and ensures a cohesive look and feel throughout the user interface.
- Design tokens can be evolved, added, or removed as needed to adapt to changing design requirements and user preferences.
- If needed check with the user so we can add/update/remove design tokens to better suit the application's needs.
