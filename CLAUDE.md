# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment (Batchtools Optimized)

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:

1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### üéØ CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:

- ‚úÖ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ‚úÖ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Project Overview

This project uses the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for systematic Test-Driven Development with AI assistance through Claude-Flow orchestration.

**üöÄ Batchtools Optimization Enabled**: This configuration includes optimized prompts and parallel processing capabilities for improved performance and efficiency.

# Project Overview - Digests Web Site

Digests is a RSS reader and podcast aggregator that allows users to subscribe to RSS feeds and podcasts, and receive daily digests of new content. The web application is built using Next.js, and TypeScript. We use Zustand for client state management, and React Query for server state management. The application is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use.

# Error Handling

The application uses standardized error handling utilities located in `utils/error-handling.ts` for consistent error management across the application. Error boundaries are implemented for React components using `components/error-boundary.tsx`.

# Digests API

The API for Digests is available at https://api.digests.app. The documentation is available at https://api.digests.app/docs

# Testing

Testing plan is saved in docs/tests/testing-plan.md. when running tests, ensure that the output of all tests is saved in .claude/logs/tests/{todaysDate}/{timestamp}-test-output.md. This will allow for easy retrieval and analysis of test results.
